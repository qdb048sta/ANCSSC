<div class="container"
    <br>
    <p class="paragraph">The Alliance of NGOs and CSOs for South-South Cooperation is the International Network of
        NGOs and
        CSOs which works in collaboration with the United Nations for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC) to enhance
        civil
        society’s understanding of the value of South-South Cooperation in developmental, humanitarian and related
        spheres.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">It encourages the sharing of knowledge, expertise and contextually appropriate technologies
        and
        assets among NGOs and CSOs, particularly those that have been developed in their respective organizational
        and
        operational experiences in developing countries.
    </p>
    <div class="col-75">
        <img class="aims_image" src="ANCSSC_aims.png" alt="ANCSSC Aims">
    </div>

    <p class="paragraph">The ANCSSC is working closely alongside the United Nations’ Office for South-South Cooperation
        and
        seek to work together to capacity build and empower organisations within the Global South through the sharing
        and
        exchange of knowledge, resources, skills, expertise and innovative ideas to quicken the speed of achieving the
        Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and to make a dent in the contribution and potential NGOs and CSOs have in
        combating global poverty through strengthening solidarity, collaboration and partnership, which speaks directly
        to
        SDG 17.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">The Alliance of NGOs and CSOs for South-South Cooperation (ANCSSC) is headed by Dr Husna Ahmad
        OBE.
        It was formed following discussions at the Ninth Global South-South Development Expo in Antalya, Turkey, in 2017
        where it was recognised that <b>NGOs and CSOs </b>have a <b>large role to play in enhancing South-South
            Cooperation to meet
            the SDGs.</b>
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">The official launch of the Alliance took place in November 2018 in New York, at the second GSSD
        Expo where Dr Husna Ahmad was chosen to be the coordinator for the Alliance.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">While conceptually South-South cooperation is not new, it was reinvigorated at the United
        Nations
        Conference on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries, held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in September
        1978.
        The Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries
        (BAPA), adopted at that conference, has lent policy and operational guidance to governments, intergovernmental
        and
        non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders in promoting SSC modalities in their humanitarian and
        development efforts, with commendable outcomes.
